        <p>
          This website has a very clean design and is very conscious of the
          space it creates between elements and images. It uses white space as
          seen here to keep elements from crowding each other, leaving the site
          pleasing to the eye. Spaces where there aren't text or images give the
          mind a chance to rest and decide where to focus. Also less chance for fat
          thumbing something you didn't want.

        <h2>Repetition</h2>
        <h3>
          The Kitchn -
          <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/recipes">recipe list</a>
        </h3>
        <img
          src="images/repetition.png"
          alt="screenshot of list of recipes with text and images"
        />
        <p>
          This page utilizes repetition in order to create a steady experience
          for the user, so they know where to look for the next item. Each image
          is the same size in the same space, every title and description is
          styled the same and is about the same length, making so there are no
          jarring differences that remove users from the flow. It's easy to
          scroll and read through.

        <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <h3>

            href="https://www.thekitchn.com/turkey-burrito-bowls-recipe-23113388"
            >recipe page</a
          >

        <img

          alt="screenshot of recipe instructions with step summary bolded"
        />
        <p>
          I liked this part of the recipe pages because of its subtle but
          effective visual hierarchy. It can be very easy to get lost it the
          steps of a recipe, but with the different colored step numbers and the
          bolded step summary, it's much easier to find what you're looking for
          as you're moving back and forth between webpage and cooking.
