    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Novice to Ninja, Chapter 2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>NON-VARIABLES: abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger,
            default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto,
            if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private,
            protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, ssynchronized, this, throw, throws, transient,
            true,
            try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield</li>
        <li>Also avoid: undefined, NaN, Infinity</li>
        <li>Data Types: string, symbol, boolean, undefiend, null, number. Anything not these, such as arrays, functions
            and object literals are called objects.</li>
        <li>Const cannot have a reassigned value later in the code, let can. Const can be mutated, however. Const is
            better used to avoid bugs.</li>
        <li>Var is outdated in javascript and I didn't know that. </li>
        <li>If you define a variable, even within a block, without let or const, it will be a global variable. Consider
            scope, always!</li>
        <li>Is there a reason to not use Template Literals always? They seem very convenient.</li>
        <li>Boolean values, always falsy: blank strings or templates, 0, -0, NaN, false, null, and undefined.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Arrays go in square brackets! Literals are easier and better than making arrays with functions.</li>
        <li>Arrays are special built-in objects rather than primitive data.</li>
        <li>You can assign to the array directly with an index number and/or replace index values.</li>
        <li>.pop removes end of array, .shift removes front, .push adds to end of array, .unshift adds to front, .join
            makes a string of the contents of the array, .slice chops out a piece of the array (non-destructive),
            .splice takes out a chunk of array and replaces it with a new value (or not)</li>
        <li>Sets are useful for elimating duplicates in arrays.</li>
        <li>Maps are basically arrays with keys and values? Unclear, need to look into this more.</li>
        <li>Shorthand if, else : condition ? (//code to run if condition is true) : (//code to run if condition is
            false)</li>
        <li>Always remember to break your switches.</li>
        <li>Don't get caught in infinite loops. :c</li>
        <li>For loops are considered clearer than do...while loops.</li>
        <li>Use i < max rather than i < array.length when looping through arrays to maximize efficiency.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Is there a reason to use anonymous functions?</li>
        <li>You can build a function in a constructor... but maybe don't.</li>
        <li>"Whether you use function declarations or function expressions is often a matter of personal
            taste, but whatever you choose to do, be consistent!" I'm a declarer, I can tell you that
            already.</li>
        <li>All functions return a value, if not stated it is returned as undefined.</li>
        <li>"any parameters a function needs are set when the function is defined. When a function is
            invoked, it is provided with arguments."</li>
        <li>When invoking a function, be aware of its parameters so youc can provide the necessary
            arguments.</li>
        <li>You can pre-set a parameter but override it with an argument. Put default parameters after the
            others.</li>
        <li>One function passed as an argument to another function is called a callback. They are clearly
            useful but
            I'm still confused.</li>
    </ul>
