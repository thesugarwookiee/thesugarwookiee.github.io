    <h1>Notes</h1>

    <h2>Novice to Ninja, Chapter 2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>NON-VARIABLES: abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger,
            default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto,
            if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private,
            protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, ssynchronized, this, throw, throws, transient,
            true,
            try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield</li>
        <li>Also avoid: undefined, NaN, Infinity</li>
        <li>Data Types: string, symbol, boolean, undefiend, null, number. Anything not these, such as arrays, functions
            and object literals are called objects.</li>
        <li>Const cannot have a reassigned value later in the code, let can. Const can be mutated, however. Const is
            better used to avoid bugs.</li>
        <li>Var is outdated in javascript and I didn't know that. </li>
        <li>If you define a variable, even within a block, without let or const, it will be a global variable. Consider
            scope, always!</li>
        <li>Is there a reason to not use Template Literals always? They seem very convenient.</li>
        <li>Boolean values, always falsy: blank strings or templates, 0, -0, NaN, false, null, and undefined.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Arrays go in square brackets! Literals are easier and better than making arrays with functions.</li>
        <li>Arrays are special built-in objects rather than primitive data.</li>
        <li>You can assign to the array directly with an index number and/or replace index values.</li>
        <li>.pop removes end of array, .shift removes front, .push adds to end of array, .unshift adds to front, .join
            makes a string of the contents of the array, .slice chops out a piece of the array (non-destructive),
            .splice takes out a chunk of array and replaces it with a new value (or not)</li>
        <li>Sets are useful for elimating duplicates in arrays.</li>
        <li>Maps are basically arrays with keys and values? Unclear, need to look into this more.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
