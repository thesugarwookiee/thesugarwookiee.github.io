      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The target audience of this website is primarily people who live in the
        Preston area and a few select surrounding towns. They are of all ages,
        but the site is primarily intended for adult use. Information should be
        accessible to someone with average education. The audience may also
        include people from out of town who are visiting. As the audience is not
        overly specific and fairly general, the site should contian basic but
        solid information.

      <p>
        <b>Name:</b> Joeseph Werthlin<br />
        <b>Gender:</b> Male<br />
        <b>Age:</b> 57<br />
        <b>Occupation:</b> High school teacher<br />
        <b>Education:</b> BA in Education<br />
        <b>Family:</b> Married, one grown child, three grandchildren<br />
        <b>Needs:</b> Joe is a hard working man. He sometimes checks the weather
        in the morning on his computer before school starts, but a lot of the
        time he looks on his ipad because it's more convenient. Sometimes when
        the kids he teaches get restless at school, he likes to take them
        outside for their lesson and preferes to know in advance if this is
        possible before he makes any promises. He also gardens extensively at
        home and likes to stay up to date on what is going on in town so he can
        be an involved citizen.<br />

      <img src="images/sadie.png" class="persona" alt="younger woman smiling at camera" />
      <p>
        <b>Name:</b> Sadie Adler<br />
        <b>Gender:</b> Female<br />
        <b>Age:</b> 33<br />
        <b>Occupation:</b> Mother<br />
        <b>Education:</b> BA in Literature<br />
        <b>Family:</b> Married, four children, another on the way<br />
        <b>Needs:</b> Sadie doesn't live in town, but she visits regularly
        because she has family in Idaho. She doesn't like to risk bringing her
        entire family all the way to Preston only to find out the weather means
        they're going to be cooped up inside all week. She preefers to visit
        when the weather will be mild, and needs to know as soon in advance as
        possible when that might be so she can plan ahead. Once the family is
        town they enjoy going out to fun events and enjoying nicer weather
        outdoors. As she's a busy mom, she mostly checks the weather on her
        phone.<br />
