    <ul>
        <li>While it's not unusual to send data in a form through PHP for processing, you can also process information
            in Javascript before sending it to the backend. </li>
        <li>The legacy DOM had a useful property calleddocument.formsthat returns an HTML collection of all the forms in
            the document in the order they appear in the markup.</li>
        <li>const form = document.forms[0]; AND const form = document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0]; AND const form =
            document.forms.search; AND const form = document.forms['search']; are all referencing the same thing. (ie
            the 'search' form that is the first and only
            form in the example)</li>
        <li>If the input field has a name attribute ofsearchInputand can be accessed using this code: const input =
            form.searchInput;</li>
        <li>Theform.reset()method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML.
        </li>
        <li>Focus even happens upon focus. Blur event happen upon removal of focus. Change even happens after you've
            changed the element and moved away. Blur fires after Change (if both present.)</li>
        <li>Default input values are fine imo if you need at least a default input when submitting, but otherwise I'd
            use placeholder.</li>
        <li>There are lots of input field types, from text to password to buttons and so forth. Look them up if you need
            them.</li>
        <li>checkboxes and radios in the same series need to have the same 'name' but different 'values'.</li>
        <li>hero.powers = [...form.powers].filter(box => box.checked).map(box => box.value);</li>
        <li>Validation can occur on the client side using JavaScript, and on the server side. It is advisable to use
            both client-side and server-side validation. JavaScript should not be relied upon to validate any data
            before it’s saved to a database.</li>
        <li>You can disable the submit button so they user can't submit with errors.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.</li>
        <li>Encapsulation: the inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the essential functionalities
            are exposed to the end user. IE - juicer takes fruit, makes juice, user doesn't see the inner workings.
        </li>
        <li>Polymorphism: the same process can be used for different objects. IE - Juicer connects to same power as
            other appliances and can also juice more than one kind of fruit.</li>
        <li>Inheritance: taking the features of one object then adding some new features. IE - A new juicer with all the
            old components with new ones added.</li>
        <li>Can build objects as object literals or constructor functions. Now you can also use Class.</li>
        <li>What’s the difference between an object's own properties and prototype properties? Prototype properties
            are shared by every instance of the Turtleclass. This means they’ll all have a weaponproperty, and it will
            always be the same value.</li>
        <li>The prototypeobject is live, so if a new property or method is added to the prototype, any instances of its
            class will inherit the new properties and methods automatically, even if that instance has already been
            created.</li>
        <li>When a property or method is called, the JavaScript engine will check to see if an object has its own
            property or method. If it does, it will use that one; otherwise, it will continue up the prototype chain
            until it finds a match or reaches the top of the chain.</li>
        <li>Properties of objects in JavaScript are said to beenumerableornon-enumerable. If they aren't enumerable,
            this means they will not show up when afor-inloop is used to loop through an object’s properties and
            methods.</li>
        <li>Good practice is for all built-in methods to be non-enumerable, and any user-defined methods to be made
            enumerable. This is so all the built-in methods don’t keep showing up when looking at an object’s methods,
            but user-defined methods are easy to find.</li>
        <li>You can add to a class with the keyword 'extends' in order to make a class even more specialized.</li>
        <li>One example of a function that uses the toString()method is the console.log()method. If an object is given
            as
            an argument to this method that isn’t a string, it will call toString()on that object in the background and
            display the return value in the console. </li>
        <li>It’s possible to avoid using classes altogether, and create new objects based on another object that acts as
            a 'blueprint' or prototype instead.</li>

                alt="prototype diagram"></li>
        <li>Because of this chain, the supermanobject has all the properties and methods of the Human and Superhuman
            objects</li>
        <li>If a method returns this, its methods can be chained together to form a sequence of method calls that are
            called one after the other: superman.fly().move().xray();</li>
        <li>It’s worth keeping in mind that if a method lacks a meaningful return value, it might as well return this so
            that chaining is possible.</li>
        <li>Note to self, use for-of instead of forEach when working with arrays in particlar to avoid needing to bind
            'this'. or else use arrows. arrow functions should be used when anonymous functions are required in
            callbacks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in
            other files and by other modules. </li>
        <li> Keeping code modular helps to make it moreloosely coupledand interchangeable, meaning you can easily swap
            one module for another without affecting other parts of a project. </li>
        <li>All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need for 'use strict' and there is no way to opt
            out of this.</li>
        <li>The scope of the module is itself and no higher.</li>
        <li>use keyword export within the module and import within the main js file using it.</li>
        <li>you don't have to export or import all parts of the module, you can select what you need on either end. or
            you can wildcard for them all!</li>
