                Don't worry about getting snowed in! Here in Soda Springs, we have you covered. Even if you have to stay
                a week or two longer than planned because a blizzard came through and knocked out the roads, there's
                nothing to worry about. We have all the free WiFi you could ever hope for, and more important than that,
                we know how to keep warm! You may find you came here on spring break, then a freak snowstorm rolled
                through. We know how to handle this, isn't the first time it's happened! With top of the line and well
                loved ski lofts, there is no lack of places to stay, and we'll keep you secure until the snow melts
                enough for you to escape to literally greener pastures.

                Here's a quick story about a family this happened to. The Salvado's were here just last year during the
                start of March, and they were less prepared for the snow than theye should have been! But it was
                alright, when they got stuck here a whole extra month, they had the time of their lives. Even their
                three-year-old daughter Hannah got so good at skiing while here in Soda Springs that she came back the
                next year and made it down a black diamond trail with no problems. They had hot chocolate every day and
                nothing to complain about even if they couldn't go home. Sometimes it seemed like they would never
                leave, and boy they sure were happy about that! So come and hang out with us, go to one of our upcoming
                events--we have plenty! And if you like soda, we'd love to talk about it with you. We aren't named Soda
                Springs for nothing!
