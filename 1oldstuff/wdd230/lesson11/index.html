            <h3>Eagerly Awaiting Spring!</h3>
            <img src="images/gallery7.jpg" class="artpic" alt="squirrel in wintery tree" />
            <p>
                It's been winter for way too long! We need it to warm up so that we don't die in this horrible gray
                cast. The sun comes out and it just makes it colder! Who designed this weather phenomenon? Frankly, I
                think we should all move somewhere without snow. I think it's the wiser choice. Look at this squirrel,
                he's so cold he can't even move from this spot in his tree. He is running out of acorns. We really need
                it to be spring so that he can smile and show us his buck teeth. He's saved up as much food as he can
                for the winter but there comes a point where the storage starts to run low. For squirrels it's all about
                their nuts for us as people, it's all about needing more sunshine and outside time. Don't you miss the
                concept of Vitamin D?
            </p>

            <p>
                The next question becomes--what are you going to do with your spring? Too often we speak about summer
                like it's the big event of the year, getting our summer bods and the like, but spring deserves its due.
                It saves us from the terror of the cold winter, melting away the snow and leaving us with fresh flowers
                that have been hiding under ground, waiting for their debut. The tulips in particular will be showing up
                soon, I've even seen them push up through the snow, so what are we waiting for? I look forward to the
                colors that will come with spring and the temperatures that warm without scorching. Idaho can be brutal
                at the extremes of the year if you aren't careful so why wait until summer to really start living? When
                you see the first bit of green show up, I say it's time for a hike or a trip out the lake--beat the
                crowds and the heat.
