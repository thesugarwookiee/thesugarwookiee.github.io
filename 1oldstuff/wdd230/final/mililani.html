                <h2>We Are Mililani</h2>
                <p>Mililani sits on former plantation fields owned by Castle & Cooke, which began planning for its
                    development in the early 1960s under its Oceanic Properties subsidiary. Castle & Cooke's plan was to
                    make Mililani Town a satellite city by using a prestigious group of planners and architects to
                    satisfy Oʻahu's great pent-up demand for housing with a sensitively designed, affordable new
                    community of a type unique in Hawaiʻi. The first homes in Mililani went on sale on June 3, 1968.</p>
                <p>The city consists of two census-designated places, Mililani Town, with a population of 27,629 at the
                    2010 census, and Mililani Mauka, with a 2010 census population of 21,039. On April 6, 1990, ground
                    was broken for Mililani Mauka, as a newer and more upscale community east of the Interstate H-2. The
                    first homeowners moved into Mauka in 1992. </p>
                <p>Located on a plateau valley between two major volcanic mountain ranges, Mililani has an elevation of
                    720 feet and is only a twenty minute drive away from the nearest beaches. It's a welcoming town with
                    enough retail and interest to keep its population settled and occupied. Largely considered a
                    commuter town for Honolulu, it nonetheless holds its own as a steady suburban town, well planned and
                    maintained.</p>

                <h2>Local Events</h2>
                <h3>People's Open Market</h3>
                <p>Founded in 1973, the People's Open Market (POM) was formed to accomplish three goals: Provide the
                    opportunity to purchase fresh agricultural and aquacultural products and other food items at low
                    cost, support the economic viability of diversified agriculture and aquaculture in Hawaii by
                    providing market sites for local farmers, fishermen, or their representatives to sell their surplus
                    and off-grade produce, and provide focal point areas for residents to socialize. An estimated half a
                    million people shop at the 25 market sites each year. Prices are usually lower than retail stores.
                    Many ethnic fruits and vegetables not normally found in the large retail stores are found here. Each
                    market operates once a week and lasts about an hour. We have one here regularly in Mililani, so come
                    check it out! <i>Next: April 13, 11-Noon</i></p>
                <h3>Mililani Jam</h3>
                <p>Join us in person for a performance from Ballet Hawaii and Musikgarten — LIVE! Ballet Hawaii was
                    established in 1976 and has over 40 years experience presenting, promoting, and developing dance in
                    Hawaii. Musikgarten Hawaii supports making music education available for anyone, from Babies to
                    Adults. We believe that from birth, children love music, and it’s never too late to start/learn how
                    to play the piano. We help our students channel their energy and focus their attention as they
                    embrace music and enjoy learning. <i>April 17, 4-7PM</i></p>
                <h3>Grocery Giveaway</h3>
                <p>Join us on Saturday, April 24 for Grocery Giveaway! We will be distributing bags of groceries to our
                    Mililani community. A drive-thru will be set up in the front parking lot of Faith Assembly of God
                    from 10am-12pm. If you're interested in volunteering, please contact Pastor Eric.</p>
