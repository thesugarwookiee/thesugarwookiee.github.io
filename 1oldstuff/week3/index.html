    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Object Method: this</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Then we can call it as user.sayHi(). The user can now speak!<br>
            A function that is a property of an object is called its method.<br>
            So, here we’ve got a method sayHi of the object user.</li>
        <li>It’s common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job. That's
            when we use "this."</li>
        <li>The value of this is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the method.</li>
        <li>Using it helps to prevent overwrite errors. It's also not bound, and thus flexible.</li>
        <li>this needs an object or it will be undefined.</li>
        <li>Arrow functions don't have 'this' and any 'this' therein will reference the object outside of the arrow
            function.</li>
        <li>The concept of 'bind' is so beyond me right now.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Novice to Ninja: Chapter 5</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions. Objects are often used to
            keep any related information and functionality together in the same place.</li>
        <li>An object literal is an object that is created directly in the language by wrapping all its properties and
            methods in curly braces.</li>
        <li>I don't know that I understand symbols... but are they common?</li>
        <li>Calling a method is the same as invoking a function, so parentheses need to be placed after the method name.
        </li>
        <li>An object is not an ordered list like an array, set or map, so you should never rely on the properties being
            in a certain order.</li>
        <li>Objects can be nested. Objects are called by reference, so if you point objects to each other and then
            change one, you will change both. This will not happen with primitive values.</li>
        <li>You can create a namespace object put related objects inside of so that they don't interfere with same-named
            objects of other functions in the future. </li>
        <li>The JSON parse() method takes a string of data in JSON format and returns a JavaScript object. The
            stringify() method does the opposite. It will, however, ignore any functions in the object.</li>
        <li>These are helpful during Ajax requests.</li>
        <li>Use the built in Math object and life will be better, I'm pretty sure.</li>
        <li>Math.floor(6 * Math.random()); get a random number bewtween 1 and 6 this way.</li>
        <li>Date() is also built in and has a number of useful data bits to pull. new
            Date(year,month,day,hour,minutes,seconds,milliseconds)</li>
        <li>RegEx and I are not friends and I don't know that we ever will be but I'll try.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>DOM treats the HTML as the root tag and everything else as children and children of children and so forth.
        </li>
        <li>DOM can be used with any programming language. Javascript accesses it through a special object called
            document.</li>
        <li>Node lists are array like objects, but not actually arrays. But you can turn one into an actual array with
            Array.from()</li>
        <li>For DOM and javascript reasons, it's very important to only ever have one instance of an ID on any given
            page.</li>
        <li>In Javascript you can 'get' elements by their ID, tag, and class. Query selectors are also useful for
            selecting more specific elements without necessarily putting IDs into your HTML.</li>
        <li>childNodes returns all nodes, including text nodes children returns only elements of that node and will
            ignore text nodes.</li>
        <li>you might expect the first child node of the ul element to be a li element, and the last child to also
            be a li element, but they are both in fact text nodes, generated by the whitespace characters in
            between the ul and li tags</li>
        <li>wonderWoman.setAttribute('class', 'villain'); is how you set attributes, with two arguments.</li>
        <li>wonderWoman.className = 'hero' can also be used to set a new class, but will overwrite all existing classes
            unlike setAttribute. classList.add can also be used to add without altering the others, as can
            classList.remove. classList.toggle will remove if present and add if not.</li>
        <li>Don't forget .display = "none" when you want to hide something until or after some event.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Speaking of events, here are events.</li>
        <li>document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething); here's the basic idea of one for clicking anywhere on
            the page.</li>
        <li>inline event listeners do look but aren't recommended for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's
            very limiting.</li>
        <li>There are many types of events, but for now it's easier to focus on interactions from input devices like the
            keyboard and mouse.</li>
        <li>mouseup, mousedown, click all are mouse events. also dblclick for special occasions. mouseover is what it
            sounds like it is, as it mouseout and mousemove.</li>
        <li>keydown, keypress, and keyup are all keyboard events. keydown is the actual pressing, keypress is actually
            typing something on the screen.</li>
        <li>touchstart and touchend are touch controls but click may be a better option in many cases</li>
        <li>if implimented correctly, removeEventListener can be used to make something only executable one time.</li>
        <li>preventDefault() exists and can stop default behavior (such as following a link) from happening upon an
            event, but likely will have little application in my own projects.</li>
    </ul>
