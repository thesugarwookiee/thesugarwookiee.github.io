    <h2>Novice to Ninja: Chapter 10</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Errors can be caused by the system, the programmer, or the user.</li>
        <li>As programmers we have little control over system errors but should be aware of them in order to avoid them
            as best we can.</li>
        <li>While we are directly responsible for programmer errors, we should make efforts to minimize user errors. We
            can do this through clarity and restrictions that prevent unwanted behavior without limiting necesary input.
        </li>
        <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the
            error. It will also produce a stack trace, which is a sequence of methods or functions that lead to the
            point of the error.</li>
        <li>Warnings aren't enough to cause the system to crash, but they can cause the program to run incorrectly and
            should be fixed.</li>
        <li>HTML will still run even if javascript has stopped, so logs should be checked to ensure function.</li>
        <li>Failing silently makes errors difficult to spot and longer to track down. Javascript is good at this. A
            ninja programmer should ensure that the code they write fails loudly in development so any errors can be
            identified early on.</li>
        <li>Strict mode increases errors by countering questionable practices. Strict mode simply requires 'use strict';
            to be added to the first line of the js file</li>
        <li>In strict mode you might get an exception where you might have otherwise gotten a warning.</li>
        <li>You can also apply strict mode within a specific function and it will only be used in that scope.</li>
        <li>Linting tools are useful for highlighting sloppy programming, but can also be overly opinionated. They are
            most useful for when you have a style guide to follow as a team.</li>
        <li>Lint does not ensure that your code is correct, per se, but it does make sure it's consistent.</li>
        <li>When you can't be sure a feature you are programming is available in a browser or other things you can't
            control, an 'if' statement can be used to check and only fire the code if it is available. Then it can fail
            gracefully instead of breaking.</li>
        <li>Alerts used to be used for debugging javascript exclusively, but we have better tools now.</li>
        <li>console.log() along with the console is one of the quickest ways to debug in the browser.</li>
        <li>the console.trace() method will log an interactive stack trace in the console. This will show the functions
            that were called in the lead up to an exception occurring while the code is running.</li>
        <li>console.table() is also very helpful for looking at arrays or objects in an organized way.</li>
        <li>console.count() counts how many times a function was called.</li>
        <li>The 'debugger' keyword puts a breakpoint into your code where you can pause and observe. Just remember to
            remove any of these later!</li>
        <li>It’s possible to throw your own exceptions using the throw statement.</li>
        <li>You can 'throw' anything and it will cause the program to stop, but it's best to throw a clear error.</li>
        <li>It is possible to handle exceptions gracefully by catching the error. Any errors can be hidden from users,
            but still identified. We can then deal with the error appropriately ― perhaps even ignore it ― and keep the
            program running.</li>
        <li>If we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in a try block. This will run the
            code inside the block as normal, but if an exception occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown
            onto a catch block.</li>
        <li>finally will fire after a try or catch block regardless of if an exception was caught. This is for anything
            you want to have run regardless of the other outcome.</li>
        <li>Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code. This is considered best
            practice but can be difficult to get into the mindset of, so it's not always popular.</li>
        <li>There are also frameworks that you can use to help to test, like Jest, but you have to install them to use
            them.</li>
    </ul>
