                <h2>True Spectacle
                </h2>
                <p>Built with the grandeur of the days behind us, the Summit Theater has maintained its origins while
                    staying up to date as a place for locals and visitors alike to come and witness some of the greatest
                    stories ever told. With high, arching ceilings and acoustics fine tuned from the beginning, sitting
                    in this theater is like journeying to a different place. Come join us as we light up the night with
                    our golden glow. Be it song, dance, or a dramatic story unfolding before you, we are certain that
                    you will be rivted from piece to piece or act to act.</p>
                <p>Join our patron group and get first seat acccess to tickets so that you never miss a show to fall in
                    love with. We believe it will be worth it to come and be swept away by the old classics and
                    contemporary plays, or the swell of the Ridgefield Orchestra. Patrons also get unique access to the
                    backstage during summer events and prime access to our suggestion box: if you want to see it, we
                    want to make it happen.</p>

                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Established in 1910, Summit Theater is a historic piece of downtown Cheyenne Point. With deep roots,
                    this original structure has stood the test of time and has seen and heard more stories than most
                    people can fathom in their lifetime. Established by Robert T. Decker alongside his sons, it thrived
                    under their leadership before passing hands to friends, associates, and the like. Under recent new
                    management, the theater's foundation is respected. Even as we upgrade and update this building that
                    we love, we strive to maintain the soul and the intention of the original build. While refurbishment
                    is ongoing, we hope you will join us for discounted tickets and light, local shows brought to you by
                    our talented town.</p>
                <p>If you have more questions about our origins, come visit us, or contact us!</p>
