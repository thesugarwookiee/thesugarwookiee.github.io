                <p class="review">We were only on the island for about a week but we really wanted to get family
                    pictures
                    while we were
                    there! Alana made it happen. We couldn't be happier with our photographs. I want to print them all!
                    I
                    love how she doesn't take things too seriously unless she needs to.</p>

                <p class="review">Could not have asked for better. Everything looks great, the editing was quick and
                    painless. And the session itself was actually a lot of fun. </p>

            <div>
                <p class="review">Spending money on something like pictures always makes me a bit weary. but Alana made
                    sure
                    that I didn't regret spending a little bit more than I normally would be comfortable with. The
                    finished
                    product is exactly what I wanted. She listened to everything I wanted and didn't make a fuss about
                    my
                    requests.</p>
                <p class="rightward reviewname">S. Gonzalez</p>

            <div>
                <p class="review">Easily the best time I've ever had going out with a photographer. She's so funny, you
                    guys. You have to see for yourself. But she got so many genuine smiles out of my kids, which is
                    basically a miracle. If I could take pictures with her every year, I absolutely would. Well worth
                    the price for the quality of the product we got. I'd spend that much to just hang out with her,
                    let's be real.</p>
