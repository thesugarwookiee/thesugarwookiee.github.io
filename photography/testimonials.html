                <p class="review">We were only on the island for about a week but we really wanted to get family
                    pictures
                    while we were
                    there! Alana made it happen. We couldn't be happier with our photographs. I want to print them all!
                    I
                    love how she doesn't take things too seriously unless she needs to.</p>

                <p class="review">We had a big family reunion on island. It was so much work to get everyone here and
                    together, I wanted to be able to remember it forever, but not be distracted by worrying about
                    pictures. I hired Alana and told her what I wanted. I was able to enjoy the day without worrying
                    about whether or not she was getting the job done. It was amazing! She took so many pictures and
                    didn't disrupt anything to get them. I love candids and she did amazing.</p>

                <p class="review">Spending money on something like pictures always makes me a bit weary. but Alana made
                    sure
                    that I didn't regret spending a little bit more than I normally would be comfortable with. The
                    finished
                    product is exactly what I wanted. She listened to everything I wanted and didn't make a fuss about
                    my
                    requests.</p>

                <p class="review">Easily the best time I've ever had going out with a photographer. She's so funny, you
                    guys. You have to see for yourself. But she got so many genuine smiles out of my kids, which is
                    basically a miracle. If I could take pictures with her every year, I absolutely would. Well worth
                    the price for the quality of the product we got. I'd spend that much to just hang out with her,
                    let's be real.</p>

                <p class="review">What I really wanted for my family pictures was somewhere unique and interesting. I
                    wasn't sure exactly what that would look like, but Alana knew exactly where to go. A few suggestion
                    and we settled on Byodo-In. It was the perfect location and full of great memories. It was nice to
                    work with someone who knows the island so well!</p>

                <p class="review">Could not have asked for better. Everything looks great, the editing was quick and
                    painless. And the session itself was actually a lot of fun. </p>

                <p class="review">If you are thinking about booking with Alana... do it! Do it! Do it! You will be over
                    the moon with the results. I feel like I made a new best friend while working with her, I swear! I
                    would hire her again in a heartbeat.</p>

                <p class="review">Not cheap, but I don't think cheap photographers are a great idea in the first place.
                    Her edits feel really natural, which was super important to my wife. The only real challenge now is
                    deciding which one we want to get printed full size. Too many good choices.</p>
