            <img src="images/self.jpg" alt="alana sitting on her bed" class="portrait">
            <p>The islands are my home! I grew up in Mililani Town and they say when you are raised in paradise it's
                hard to want to go anywhere else. So true! I love being here and being able to share this beautiful
                place with others. Be it for your destination wedding or your military deployment, there are so many
                memories to make on Oahu.</p>
            <p>I know your time here is special, and I know the memories you make with your loved ones are important.
                You don't want to forget them, and I want help! Got an event here on Oahu? A wedding? A family reunion?
                Or do you just want a little family photoshoot? I am prepared to help you put these sweet reminders into
                picture form. I've been working at this since 2012 and I bring a sense of professional fun to the table.
                I will make sure you get exactly what you want while also making sure we're having a great time. Afraid
                your shy kiddo won't smile? Trust me, I have a few tricks we can try!</p>
            <p>Whether your vision is big or small, I really love meeting new clients and getting to know you. Let me be
                your next partner in photography, I promise you won't regret it.</p>

                How far out in advance do you book?
            </button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I can book out about a year in advance in most cases, but I am willing to discuss anything
                    within
                    reason. I recommend contacting me as soon as possible with your dates as my schedule can
                    fill up
                    fast, especially during the spring.</p>

                Do we have to do our photoshoot on the beach?
            </button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Of course not! Hawaii is about way more than the water. There are beautiful mountains and
                    forests to
                    consider. The good news about island living is we can get just about anywhere within a small
                    amount
                    of time. So pick your dream spot!</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>While my style works best for a few people, I love big groups! If you have a family reunion
                    and want
                    me to make sure memories are captured, I am happy to work with your group.</p>

                I have a wedding on another island. Can you come take photos?

            <div class="content">
                <p>Oahu is where I'm based and typically where I do my work. Under special circumstances,
                    however, I
                    might be able to make the journey to a different island. Feel free to contact me and we can
                    discuss
                    whether or not we are a fit.</p>

            <h2>Testimonials</h2>
            <p class="review">We were only on the island for about a week but we really wanted to get family pictures
                while we were
                there! Alana made it happen. We couldn't be happier with our photographs. I want to print them all! I
                love how she doesn't take things too seriously unless she needs to.</p>
            <p class=" rightward reviewname">V. Banner</p>
            <p class="review">Could not have asked for better. Everything looks great, the editing was quick and
                painless. And the session itself was actually a lot of fun. </p>
            <p class=" rightward reviewname">M. Martin</p>
            <p class="review">Spending money on something like pictures always makes me a bit weary. but Alana made sure
                that I didn't regret spending a little bit more than I normally would be comfortable with. The finished
                product is exactly what I wanted. She listened to everything I wanted and didn't make a fuss about my
                requests.</p>
