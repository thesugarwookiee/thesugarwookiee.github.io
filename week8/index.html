    <h2>HTML5 and CSS3 For the Real World: Chapter 8</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.
        </li>
        <li>The value of the transform property is one or more transform functions (separated by spaces) that will be
            applied in the order they’re provided.</li>
        <li>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. A translated element can only be
            moved relative to its current position.</li>
        <li>Transforms don’t work on inline elements, so change it to block if it's not working.</li>
        <li>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically.</li>
        <li>Remember that scale will not affect the flow of elements around it, so if that's an issue change other
            aspects instead of using scale such as height, width, or font size.</li>
        <li>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.</li>
        <li>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.</li>
        <li>transform-origin is used to change the origin of the transformation away from center of the object.</li>
        <li>The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction
            will be on the rotated axis.</li>
        <li>CSS transitions generally require less client-side processing than javascript, so they’ll usually appear
            smoother, which is very important on mobile.</li>
        <li>Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations.
        </li>
        <li><img src="steps.png" alt="steps to make transition happen"></li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties">Animatable properties</a>
        </li>
        <li>In itself, the transition-property property has no effect; that’s because we still need to specify the
            duration of the transition.</li>
        <li>200ms is generally considered the optimum time for a transition: anything slower will make the website seem
            slow, drawing generally unwanted attention to what was supposed to be a subtle effect. Anything faster may
            be too subtle.</li>
        <li>The most common timing functions include the key terms ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out.</li>
        <li>These properties can all be placed into shorthand transition property. The properties in the shorthand
            syntax can be in any order, however, if a delay is included, you must also include a duration, and the
            duration must precede the delay.</li>
        <li>You can transition multiple properties at once, separated by a comma, or using 'all' if all will be the same
            duration.</li>
        <li>For true CSS animation, use keyframes. Keyframes are declared in percentages of the duration. Declare your
            duration or it defaults to 0 and nothing will happen.</li>
        <li>If using the shorthand property, be careful with your animation-name. You want to avoid accidentally using
            any animation property key term such as forwards, running, or alternate. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>With HTML5’s Canvas API you can draw anything you can imagine through JavaScript.</li>
        <li>The canvas element takes both a width and height attribute, which must also be set, and should not be set in
            CSS.</li>
        <li>A lot can be done with Canvas, making shapes and using patterns and fills. Look them up when you need to use
            it, there's lot of resources out there.</li>
        <li>You can use Canvas to put a picture onto a site and also convert it to black and white. You could also do
            this with video.</li>
        <li>A major downside of canvas in its current form is its lack of accessibility. The canvas doesn’t create a DOM
            node, is not a text-based format, and is thus essentially invisible to tools such as screen readers.</li>
        <li>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics
            using XML.</li>
        <li>The viewBox attribute defines the starting location, width, and height of the SVG image.</li>
        <li>The element in SVG is often the name of the shape, such as 'circle'. [circle cx="50" cy="50" r="25"
            fill="red"/]</li>
        <li>A 'desc' tag will let you add a description to your SVG viewBox</li>
        <li>Drag and drop API is very useful but has limited support so far.</li>
        <li>These API options are worth looking into when the functions become necessary in a site but should not be
            used frivolously, I don't think.</li>
    </ul>
