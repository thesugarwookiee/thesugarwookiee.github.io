    <h2>Final Project</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The application I've made it simple enough. I felt like my biggest struggle this semester was the javascript
            itself, so I wanted to focus on that. So you have here a javascript based browser game! Sometimes it's
            called memory, other times it's called concentration. Either way, everyone has played it before at one point
            or another, but this time you can play it online and you don't have to shuffle the cards around yourself,
            isn't that fun?<br><br>The other piece present here is the quote API I'm pulling from. Every time you load
            the page, refresh the game, or make a match, the quote alongside the game will change. It's both a reward
            for making a match and a distraction from remembering the cards you've already flipped.</li>
        <li>There are 16 card tiles laid out in a grid. Click one, and it will turn over. Click another, and then
            they'll both flip back over, unless it happens to be a match! If it's a match, they will remain flipped.
            Once you've flipped over all the cards, you win! The counter in the corner keeps track of how many turns
            you've taken, so try for a high score. The lowest I've seen from my friends who have tested it is 10, though
            in theory if the stars align you could get 8... but that would be extreme luck.</li>
        <li>CSS:
            <ul>
                <li>Plenty of grid! Grid used to lay out the page in its entirety, as well as to lay out the grid of
                    cards!</li>
                <li>Padding, padding everywhere... no one likes a website that's all shoved up against all the other
                    elements!</li>
                <li>Rounded borders on tiles and buttons, as well as careful use of solid borders to make subtle design
                    elements.</li>
                <li>Colors that aren't distracting from the game but look nice. Same with changing of font to a google
                    font.</li>
                <li>Made the quote section stand out without letting it shout. Aligned the author name to make it look
                    neat instead of like I was just printing API info to the page.</li>
                <li>On hover, the tiles recieve a yellow border. Also on hover, the tiles lose opacity, but ONLY on the
                    unflipped "side".</li>
                <li>Speaking of sides, used a transform to 'flip' the tiles. Slid the 'back' of the card out of the way
                    to show the 'bottom' of the card, but made it instantaneous so you don't see the slide.</li>
                <li>Also a delay on 'flipping' the tile back over once you've failed to make a match.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For my design process, I started out thinking that I wanted to make a game with Javascript. From there I ran
            through a few ideas, brainstormed. Landed on my current game and went from there. I first got the basics
            laid out for the format and then worked on game logic. After I got game logic working, it was on to adding
            the smaller things like the API and the counter. I just worked on it steadily when I could.</li>
        <li>I definitely altered away from my original idea. I thought at first to make the backs of the cards pull from
            an API, but I actually really struggled with how to do that. A lot of googling and I never found a way to
            make it work, since the image as I have it pulls from the CSS and not the html. If there was a way I never
            found it and eventually I decided there were better ways to get what I was after.</li>
        <li>Problems were just the normal ones! Not really knowing how to do some things was hard. Finding an API that
            would cooperate with me was one of them. I know how to pull an API but so many weren't great for what I was
            after. Took me a while to figure out how to get the counter to work the way I wanted it to--math is hard!
            Especially in code! But I'm very proud of my solution I ended up with.</li>
        <li>As far as topics in the course go, I really felt like javascript was important for me to lean into here. It
            was the part that I found the most frustrating throughout everything, and as it was the core of everything,
            I wanted to use this project to prove to myself that I could make it work for me. It was applied throughout
            the game and the logic of it. There were also event handlers to handle clicking and resets and loading and
            all of that. From there the API was worked in to different events to randomize the quote, and the JSON
            obviously to get the actual data from that.</li>
