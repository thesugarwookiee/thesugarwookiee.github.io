            provides historical information as well as current. Patrons will be able to view a schedule, buy tickets,
            and learn about past, current, and upcoming shows.
        </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Manrope</h4>
        <p>This is a san-serif font that is unique but easy to read. I like my header fonts to be straightforward and
            professional in appearance. In this case, the subject of temples and the ammenties used to attend them lends
            itself to something clean and accessible without frills. </p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Noto Serif</h4>
        <p>Similar to the header font, this is a simple, readable font that feels professional and not overbearing. I
            prefer to mix serif with non-serif fonts, and body text takes serif font well. Readable but appropriate to
            the mood set by the site.</p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and
            Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
            Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and
            experienced rafters. No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company
            can make it happen for you.</p>
