    <h2>Example 1</h2>
    <p>Justify-content and align-content do not work since the grid is as big as the parent element.</p>

    <h2>Example 2</h2>
    <p>Justify-items and align-items do not work since the contents are as big as the grid cell they are in.</p>

        <h1>Block vs Inline alignment</h1>
        <p>Earlier in the semester you were introduced to the concept of
            <kbd>block</kbd> and <kbd>inline</kbd> elements. Blocks flow
            vertically down the page by default, and inline flows horizontally across.
            You were also shown how to center both inline and block elements.
            Let's review that again now. Follow the activity instructions to make this poem flow down the page.</p>
